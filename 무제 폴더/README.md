To create a virtual environment, Python supplies a built in venv module which provides the basic functionality needed for the virtual environment. Running the command below will create a virtual environment named "openai-env" inside the current folder you have selected in your terminal / command line:

```python
source venv/bin/activate
```

```python
pip3 install --upgrade openai
```

You should see the terminal / command line interface change slightly after you active the virtual environment, it should now show "openai-env" to the left of the cursor input section. For more details on working wit virtual environments, please refer to the official Python documentation.
